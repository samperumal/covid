# CCSSA Triage Guidelines (2 April 2020)

This tool is approved by the [Western Cape Department of Health](https://www.westerncape.gov.za/dept/health/)
as per circular H110 of 2020, and has been endorsed by the [Critical Care Society of South Africa](https://criticalcare.org.za/)
and the [Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa](https://emssa.org.za/).

It is intended solely for the use of qualified doctors who are
already familiar with the guidelines, and who need an electronic
aid to speed up the calculation of Priority Scores for triage
management.
This application provides an interactive version of the triage flowchart presented
in the **WESTERN CAPE CRITICAL CARE TRIAGE TOOL** documentation.

## Setup

Initialise yarn

```
yarn
```

## Run local

The following command starts a local dev server on http://localhost:1234, with Parcel building, serving and watching.

```
yarn dev
```

## Build

Build a static version of the site to the `dist/` folder.

```
yarn build
```

## Test

Run jest test suite

```
yarn test
```

## Prettier

Run prettier to autoformat all code files changed since the last commit

```
yarn pretty-quick
```

This should mostly be unnecessary since the pre-commit hook will take care of any files staged in git on each commit
